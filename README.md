**1. Agile & JIRA**<br/><br/>
(Every day task assigned to you and  It is project Management software , Team lead/manager/scrum master will assign the task to you by JIRA Software).<br/>
**2.Maven( Build Tools)**<br/>
 Maven only for java &  Gradle  (These are used to automate the build process of the project) for any language.<br/><br/>
using these tool we can create  the project, we can download the dependency , complie the project, exceute unit test cases, package the project as jar file or war file.<br/>
**3.Github & BitBucket**<br/>
These are  version control software.They are used to store all the developers source code at one place.<br/>
**4.Logging** **(LOG4J/ LOG4J2/LogBack/LogStash)**<br/>
 It is used to store application execution details to a  file. To perform the logging we are using LOG4J/ LOG4J2/LogBack/LogStash.<br/>
 we neede to store  application execution details To understand execution process and to understand execptions occuring in the project.<br/>
 when customers are accessing the application there is chance of getting a problem why where problem occured which class which method which line number having problem
 we need to trouble shoot the problem. to troble shoot the problem we are going to use logging in the project.<br/>
 **5.Log Monitoring** **(Putty/WinScp/Splunk)**<br/>
 These are tools used for taking log file see the log message understand the problem  go to project fix the problem. <br/>
 Example: my application is running in a server  this server  is installed inside a linux machine. Machine is in USA<br/><br/>
 when my application is executing  the application will create a log life logs will be stored in a file.<br/>
 when the customer is accessing the application code is exceuted log messages  will be generated they will be stored  in log file log file will be there on log server.
 it is also there in usa.<br/>
 customer raised an issue that he is unable to login in to application ( 500 error internal server error).<br/>
 I am in hyd I am working on project  my project belongs to usa client.Now from my computer  in hyd i should connect to log server in usa. I should access log messages
  to understand the problem. <br/>
 To connect from one  computer to another computer  use a tool called  putty/WinScp.<br/>
 Like today we got a bug login functionality not working  check log file understand problem let me know the fix. <br/>
 **6.Unit Testing** **(Junit & PowerMock)**
 let us take an example I am wirting a method
 m1()
 {
 // 10 lines in m1 method  10 lines of code is available  how this 10 lines  of codde is available
 }

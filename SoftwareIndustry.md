**Software IT Industry:**<br/>
**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**<br/>
**Software Industry Details:**<br/>
we can see 3 types of Companies in IT:<br/>
**1.Product Based Companies:** They will develop and Sell in Market.<br/>
**Examples:** Apple, Samsung, Dell, Oracle, Amazon, Mircosoft etc..<br/>
**2.Service Based Companies:** They develop projects for clients.(Based on Requirments of Client).<br/>
**Examples:** TCS, Infosys, Wipro, TechM, HCL, Deloitte, Capgem, CTS, etc.. <br/>

1.**Scratch Project**- 10%<br/>
2.**Maintence/ Support Project** -80% -(adding  new functionality to exisiting project, chance exisiting functionality, fix probelms in project).<br/>
 Work in Maintence Project:<br/>
        1.**Change Request -(CR) Modifying Existing Code:**<br/>
        functionality already existing client asking  to change behaviour. <br/>
        Like preveioulsy email OTP validation now client Requirement is Mobile OTP validation.<br/>
        Earlier exporting data to Excel file. now client want to export data to PDF file.<br/>

        3.**Bug Fixing :** 
        Project already Running  customers are accessing but  we are getting bugs in the project we need to fix bugs available in code.<br/>
       **we need to monitor the log files using putty/ winscp/splunk.**<br/>
       **By using any of these like putty/winscp/ splunk software we can connect to log server and analyze the log messages in log files and fix the bugs in the project.**<br/>
       4.**Production Support: (Complete Monitoring)**(Critical Task)<br/>
       We need to monitor the logs 24/7.we need to report the bugs to the development team.<br/>
       They give you access for splunk  24/ 7.we need to monitor the logs.when exception occured take screenshot of exception send exception to deveploemnt team they analyze the problem and fix it.<br/>
3.**Migration Project -10%** -(upgrading project to latest technology. changing project from one Tech to another Tech)<br/>
**Example:** Earlier projects are developed using IBM MainFrames techonlogy. Now they are develpoing using java / python<br/>.
**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**<br/>
**Types of Teams**<br/>
1.**offshoreTeam**(Development+ Testing + operations) .  here developers, testers, devops Engineers, Cloud Enginners will be there.<br/>
2.**onshoreTeam**(Client location - Functional Team/ Business  Analysists Team)<br/>
**Bridge Calls**(Zoom/webEx/Skype)<br/>
For every meeting we have to prepare MOM(Mintues of meeting).<br/>
**--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**<br/>
**Developers Role & Responsibilities**<br/>
**1.Understand Requirements :**<br/>
we get requirements from functional team. b/w develpoment team and client functional team will be there.<br/>
Functional team share requirement document with development team  and testing team.<br/>
**2.Query Log Preparation:**<br/>
It is used to write down all doubts on requirments.<br/>
**3.Connect with Functional Team:**<br/>
Functional team is responsible to provide clarification on these doubts.<br/>
**4.Raise Request for Git Repo Creation:**<br/>
we need to raise request for devops team to  create git repo or bitbucket repo. by raising JIRA request. Devops team create repo and share details with development team.<br/>
**5. Raise Request for pipeline Creation :**<br/>
we need jenkins pipeline to automate build and deployment process of our project. we need to raise request for deveops team  by JIRA .<br/>
**6.Database Tables Design:**<br/>
understand how many tables we need for requirments.  what columns we need. the relations we need to normalize the  data.<br/>
**7.Development /coding**:<br/>
writing business logic required for the project design.<br/>
**8.Unit Testing**<br/>
code developed by developers  must be tested as it is working as excepted or not.<br/>
**9.Code Review (SonarQube)**<br/>
mistakes done in code like naming convention, best practises not following in code,chances of getting bugs in code is identified  as part of code review.<br/>
**10.Code Integration (Repo)**<br/>
all developers code must be integrated at a place. your code must not effect other team members code available in repository.<br/>
**11.Code Deployment in Dev Environment**<br/>
when he/she did coding it worked in local system. Is that code working as execpted after integration. For this jenkins job is created by devops team.<br/>
**Jenkins pipeline we need to execute to run our code in dev Environment**<br/>.
**12.Integration Testing- (Developer Integration Testing)**<br/>
Is our code working perfectly or not after code Integration.<br/>
**13.Bug Fixing**<br/>
**14.SIT Support -( System Integration Testing)**<br/>
 It is done by testing team. They identify bugs and report identified buys by raising JIRA ticket to development team.<br/>
 If every thing works well they provide cerified code.(SIT passed). Then it goes to UAT.<br/>
 **15.UAT support**<br/>
UAT is done by client side team or client. they again test application working properly or not.<br/>
**16.Production Environment**<br/>
 It is final environment of the application.<br/>
**Note: Code which is deployed in production Environment It will be accessed by end users.**<br/>
when end users are accessing the application there are chances of getting some issues. production issuess.<br/>
If we dont fix production issue client business will be stopped.<br/>
**we need to trouble shoot why issue occured. By using logs of the application.** **Hence we need to know to monitor logs of the application by using log monitoring tools like splunk/ putty.**<br/>
**17. Documentation**<br/>
project Architecture, modules of project, purpose of each module. exceution flow of the project, database design of the project.<br/>
